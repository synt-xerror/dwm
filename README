dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

You can find the original project website on: https://dwm.suckless.org


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.

I use rofi as my app launcher and kitty as my terminal emulator. So if you want to use this, install both or change these apps on config.h.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your ~/.xinitrc to start dwm using startx command:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make
sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

The xsetroot command won't work to change the text on the bar, instead it have two variables on dwm.c: stext and stext2 (top bar and bottom bar). Check out the drawbars() and drawbar() functions to understand more how it works.

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.

My preference is to edit dwm.c directely by now, but will make my functions to config.h soon.
